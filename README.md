# Twin Mountains

This is a Twin Peaks fan game I made! It's mostly a demo to show off some of my tech art skills in unity!

I created all shaders for this game myself (for the terrain, waterfall, etc), as well as the fog system and the texture on the character.

The character Model, rig, and animation are from https://kenney.nl, but I did the texture for the character myself (to make him look like agent cooper from the show). The house components and the trees are also from this source.
